## What is this?

Picking a restaurant can sometimes be a daunting task. Even with Yelp, it is never easy. The endless variables, from cuisine, price, and location to rating and hours, can be overwhelming. This project is made as a part of a contest organized by Capital One on mindsumo where I created a web app to help people pick the right restaurant.
